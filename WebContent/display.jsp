<tr><td><b>Mainstream Hollywood can get it right when it tries</b></br> <strong>Rating 5</strong> | by Adam Peters at Sep 9 2014 15:34 EST </td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Mr Tom Cruise's good form continues with this fine, fun sci-fi action flick that could be likened to a video game in the best possible sense of the term. The action set-pieces themselves are really very well done, and like all good big blockbuster movies this is hugely enjoyable throughout, with an interesting, if not entirely faultless plot. The fact that this pulls the Groundhog day trick that as it happens didn't fill every person that went to go see it with a huge groan of boredom is in itself quite an accomplishment. And with Godzilla, X-men and now this, mainstream Hollywood is being quite generous these past few weeks. Yet another big- screen must-watch crowd-pleaser.</p></td></tr>
