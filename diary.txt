Nov  3  11:30  16:00        5        Tomcat7 issue, download setup new tomcat 7, it seems to be the problem of 
                                     MiaowuMovie, because CastExercie works fine with tomcat7. Things tried:
                                     1) reverse all local changes to last commit; 2) create new project, add files gradually
                                     3) CastExercise and JSP-Full, all working well; 4) derby.log, no useful info;
                                     5) ControllerServlet logger - when dead, it doesn't even reach servlet init(); but
                                     when DB is shutdown, it does reach init() and processRequest()
