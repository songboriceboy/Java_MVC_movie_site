Oct 25  13:10  16:30        5        Think about login() - Viwer / Owner separate or together? 
                                     Coding DB Connection - Service Locator pattern. JUnit test fail. Debug,
                                     compare with labs, confuse. Add common-xxxx.jar files and it worked.

Oct 30  12:10  13:10        8        moviedetails.jsp, Tomcat no response, Derby lost SA schema once server shutdown, 
Nov  3  11:30  16:00        5        Tomcat7 issue, download setup new tomcat 7, it seems to be the problem of 
                                     MiaowuMovie, because CastExercie works fine with tomcat7. Things tried:
                                     1) reverse all local changes to last commit; 2) create new project, add files gradually
                                     3) CastExercise and JSP-Full, all working well; 4) derby.log, no useful info;
                                     5) ControllerServlet logger - when dead, it doesn't even reach servlet init(); but
                                     when DB is shutdown, it does reach init() and processRequest()
Nov  4  16:00  17:50        5        Reverse to previous commits (by branching, checkout). Found the problem occurred since
                                     4th commit (Home Search SQL). Add logging to ControllerServlet and DBFactory. Found 8
                                     command were initialised, not the 9th (MovieDetailsCommand). Realise it is the max number
                                     of connection in pool (maxActive attribute in context.xml).    
        22:00  22:30        4        MoviedDetails, movieDetails operation cannot be resolved
Nov  5  09:30  10:20        9        MoviedDetails bug fixed,

        16:30  18:40        8        ShowCinemaScheduleCommand, addmovietime.jsp, Google Java Pair, create own Pair to avoid
                                     using Map.Entry a lot, test.jsp & TestCommand to test Pair with JSTL, fail and give up.
        22:20  23:30        8        Review JSTL, schedule table implement, Google Java Date difference,

        14:00  15:40        7        ShowCinemaScheduleCommand, testing Pair succeeds (silly mistake),

        13:10  14:00        6        commit, but time is set to Oct 23 on my computer, BitBucket check, mucking around with 
                                     SourceTree - try creating new branch for correct commit date, delete, change Sys date back
                                     to normal. It seems the Bitbucket remote repo will be broken forever because of that 
                                     time-error commit.
        16:10  17:50        8        Fix bug in ShowCinemaScheduleCommand, AddMovieTimeCommand, 
        18:40  21:30        9        AddMovieTimeCommand, DAO & JDBC transaction, JSTL param, refactor: use tspA instead of

TODO:
- unique username
- Better way to distinguish viewer and owner when login.
- form validation
- Email and user activation
- Upload poster image
- single quote in sql text (insert a review comment)
- search.jsp owner-search.jsp common code
- Java and JSP constants enum (parameter names)
- better exception handling
- my own Pair class
- custom JSP tag?
- LAYOUT: all align to center of page; schedule table fix cell width; 
- Enum: Movie Status (Now Showing, Coming Soon, No future...)
- ID column of each table uses unique name ('movieID', 'scheduelID' ...) instead of 'id' for all
- centralise date formatting
